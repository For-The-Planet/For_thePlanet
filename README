# LexDrive: For The Planet, ("LexDrive")

LexDrive is a secure, open-source platform that combines GitHub-style version 
control with OneDrive-style file management - built specifically for lawyers, 
nonlawyers, and public interest advocates. It does two things: (1) enables legal 
professionals to collaborate on documents with full transparency and version history 
and (2) provides public users with access to editable legal forms. Initially imagined 
by someone with no computer skills. Feedback and assistance highly valued.

## Purpose

LexDrive is designed to support:

- Legal professionals who need secure, trackable document collaboration across 
teams.
- Public interest advocates, legal aid organizations, and community lawyers working 
to deliver access to justice through sharable, editable legal forms.
- Clients and pro se litigants who need to easily find, fill out, and download critical 
legal documents.

By integrating legal workflows with accessible, open-source technology, LexDrive 
seeks to modernize legal document management without sacrificing usability or 
security.
